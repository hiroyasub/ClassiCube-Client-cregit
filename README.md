**Welcome to ClassiCube**
-----
The block-based game that you will enjoy for a very long time!

ClassiCube is an extension of Minecraft Classic, which has been described as a "virtual bin of LEGO blocks". Our version of Minecraft Classic includes many bug fixes and performance improvements (read: it runs faster and has less problems!) and includes a brand new and optional set of blocks for your enjoyment.

Some improvements include...

  *  A standalone client that works with both our website AND Minecraft.net!
  *  The ability to load texture packs (which allows you to re-skin almost everything in the game, including the menu buttons!)
  *  A better framerate limiter that will lock your framerate to 60 instead of a random number!
  *  HD texture support!
  *  A brand new set of 16 **optional** and attractive [blocks](http://wiki.vg/Classic_Protocol_Extension#CustomBlocks)!
  *  The ability to upload a character skin for FREE!

If you're an avid fan of Minecraft and you've been around [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/) lately, you probably noticed that Mojang removed all links to Minecraft Classic. This made it so only people with the **[URL](https://minecraft.net/classic/list)** were able to get to the list. After this and other few reasons, almost every single server has been shut down.

We thought this was absolutely terrible. After all, while Minecraft Premium is **EXCELLENT** (capitals AND bold, wow!), Minecraft Classic has a certain charm to it, and we felt that **everybody** should have a chance to experience it.

With tons of support from Classic client and server developers, we've created a brand new extension of Classic that builds upon what the original classic was - an excellent time-wasting game. With full control over the client, we took it upon ourselves to add things to it, including the [Classic Protocol Extension](http://wiki.vg/Classic_Protocol_Extension), a way of adding new things (including a new set of blocks) to classic, while still allowing old servers to allow new clients, and new servers to allow old clients, without breaking anything!

So what are you waiting for? [Sign up!](http://www.classicube.net/acc/register/) It's super easy, and best of all, it's free! Who knows, maybe you'll meet more friends here!

The Client
-----
This, the ClassiCube-Client is what we use to bring you the best of the newest features Classic servers have to offer, have it be with our own [Stand-Alone Client](http://static.classicube.net/client/ClassiCube.exe) or just the normal [In-Browser Client](http://www.classicube.net/server/list/). We are doing our best to bring you the Classic Minecraft you always wanted.

Here on our GitHub page you can submit suggestions, bugs, even your own custom code to be possibly added to the client its self.
